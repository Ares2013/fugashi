# fugashi

Fugashi is a Cython wrapper for [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/). It
doesn't attempt to cover all of the potential use cases of MeCab, instead
dealing with only the most common ones.

- Only UniDic is supported, you can't use IPADic. UniDic Neologd is fine.
- Only UTF-8 is supported.
- Only Python3 is supported.
